# CeredrilsCharaChorderCheatsheets

Welcome to my collection of CharaChorder cheatsheets! This repository aims to provide clear, comprehensive, and easy-to-reference documentation for various CharaChorder needs.

## Overview

The CharaChorder is a unique input device that combines 2 interesting ideas:

1. 3D Input
2. chord typing capabilities (chording) next to traditional keyboard character entry (chentry).

These cheatsheets are my own takes on what is useful for interacting with a CharaChorder an in no way affiliated with the company
