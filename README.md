# CharaChorderCheatsheets

A collection of convenient and easy-to-reference cheatsheets for CharaChorder devices.

## About CharaChorders

CharaChorder combines two interesting ideas:

1. [3D Input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH87_pgb8yE)
2. [chord typing capabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorded_keyboard)(chording) next to traditional keyboard character entry (chentry)

These cheatsheets are my own takes on what is useful for interacting with their devices
